        <p>Ahoy!</p>
        <p>As an effort to improve my writing skills (one of my personal goals for the next months), I'm starting to blog again. I'm still not sure what sort of things I will address here, but topics like education, programming, running, photography or cinema will surely come off.</p>
        <p>This time, instead of picking up some uber complete blog engine, I picked up <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">jekyll</a> which looks really simple. It has a really neat integration with github pages and allows me to focus on the content rather than other things such as configurations and plugin management. I'm still getting used to it looks great so far.</p>
